Top rules for a better app.
- keep the code clean

- respect SRP. both for functions and services

- define the UI and UI flow

- use typescript if you are developing a javascript application

- deploy ASAP; it will be nice to have a CI/CD as well

- use docker if possible 

- receive feedback ASAP

- DON'T ignore the security; open ports, invalid firewall rules, not sending anything over a non secure layer

- implement you application with a reverse proxy.

- don't use small functionalities from  external libraries. e.g. moment or lodash. this will only increase your bundle. the same applies for css libraries

- create the application arhitecture BEFORE start coding the MVP

- check the responsive part of the app

- use a microservice arhitecture
  	- why not having a email service, socket service, back-end service, external storage for images, external server for form data?

- create the unit tests/ functional tests as you consider . at least main flows should be covered. If possible to use TDD, just do it!	


- study and apply the GOF design patterns where possible. Not over engeneering but somethimes it worth.

- if SEO is required, it will be nice to make a research of what library will be use. for react there is Next.js , for angular angular universal. A good option could be Php, python or something else. 


- create wrappers around functionalities/ components which may change frequently. 


- separate your logic flow by the bussiness flow.

- use sugestive names for everything. 

- don't use adittinal code/variables for something you can refactor. It will end up by having multiple flows for the same thing
