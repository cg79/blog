This work, close over the years, is currently scattered in several parts, making it difficult to find the same solution after some time. Because of this, I decided to make a blog, where to gather all this information, to be in one place, where to document the ideas, the steps, the source code, thus making it easier for me to find solutions. for example, I remember the time when I used docker to implement a project as this process was challenging. The steps were looking for, implementing, testing, improving and possibly looking for another more optimal solution. This process lasts, it's not necessarily pleasant and sometimes frustrating. The same thing happened with kubernetes. I started locally with minikube, and previously I researched and implemented docker swarm.
